# shinyjs

`shinyjs` lets you perform common useful JavaScript operations in Shiny 
applications without having to know any JavaScript. You can
[check out a demo Shiny app](http://daattali.com:3838/shinyjs-demo/) that lets
you play around with some of the functionality that `shinyjs` makes available,
or [have a look at a very basic Shiny app](http://daattali.com:3838/shinyjs-basic/)
that uses `shinyjs` to enhance the user experience with very minimal and 
simple R code.

## Installation

`shinyjs` is available through GitHub:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("daattali/shinyjs")
```

## Motivation

Shiny is a fantastic R package provided by RStudio that lets you turn any R
code into an interactive webpage.  It's very powerful and one of the most
useful packages in my opinion. But there are just a few simple pieces of
functionality that I always find missing and I implement myself in my Shiny apps using
JavaScript (JS) because it's either not supported natively by Shiny or it's just
cleaner to do so. Simple things like showing/hiding elements, enabling/disabling
a button, showing a popup message to the user, manipulating the CSS class or
HTML content of an element, etc.

After noticing that I'm writing the same JS
code in all my apps, and since making Shiny talk to JS is a bit tedious
and annoying with all the message passing, I decided to just package it to make
it easily reusable.  Now I can simply call `hide("panel")` or `disable("button")`.
I was lucky enough to have previous experience with JS so I knew how to
achieve the results that I wanted, but for any Shiny developer who is not
proficient in JS, hopefully this package will make it easy to extend the power
of their Shiny apps.

## Overview of main functions

- `show`/`hide`/`toggle` - display or hide an element. There are arguments
that control the animation as well, though animation is off by default.

- `hidden` - initialize a Shiny tag as invisible (can be shown later with a call
to `show`)

- `enable`/`disable`/`toggleState` - enable or disable an input element, such
as a button or a text input.

- `info` - show a message to the user (using JavaScript's `alert` under the
hood)

- `text` - change the text/HTML of an element (using JavaScript's `innerHTML`
under the hood)

- `onclick` - run R code when an element is clicked. Was originally developed
with the sole purpose of running a `shinyjs` function when an element is
clicked, though any R code can be used.

- `addClass`/`removeClass`/`toggleClass` - add or remove a CSS class from
an element

- `inlineCSS` - easily add inline CSS to a Shiny app

- `logjs` - print a message to the JavaScript console (mainly used for
debugging purposes)

[Check out the demo Shiny app](http://daattali.com:3838/shinyjs-demo/) to see
some of these in action, or install `shinyjs` and run `shinyjs::runExample()`
to see more demo apps.

## Basic use case - working example

*You can view the final Shiny app developed in this simple example
[here](http://daattali.com:3838/shinyjs-basic/).*

Suppose we want to have a simple Shiny app that collects a user's basic
information (name, age, company) and submits it, along with the time of
submission.  Here is a very simple implementation of such an app (nothing
actually happens when the user "submits").

```
library(shiny)
shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(
    div(id = "myapp",
      h2("shinyjs demo"),
      textInput("name", "Name", ""),
      numericInput("age", "Age", 30),
      textInput("company", "Company", ""),
      p("Timestamp: ", span(date())),
      actionButton("submit", "Submit")
    )
  ),
  
  server = function(input, output) {
  }
)
```

*Note that I generally don't like running Shiny apps like this and prefer to
declare the UI and server separately, but I do it like this here for brevity.*

Here is what that app would look like

![Demo app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daattali/daattali.github.io/master/img/blog/shinyjs/basic-v1.png)

Now suppose we want to add a few features to the app to make it a bit more
user-friendly. Here are 6 features, each followed with a way to implement
it using `shinyjs`:

In order to use most `shinyjs` functions, a call to `useShinyjs()` needs to be
made in the Shiny app's UI. This is required to set up all the JavaScript and a
few other things.

**Note:** for many of the functions to work, the app's server needs to have
the `session` parameter declared, ie. initialize the server as
`server(input, output, session)` instead of `server(input, output)`.

**1. The "Name" field is mandatory and thus the "Submit" button should not be
enabled if there is no name**

In the server portion, add the following code

```
observe({
  if (is.null(input$name) || input$name == "") {
    shinyjs::disable("submit")
  } else {
    shinyjs::enable("submit")
  }
})
```

**2. The "Age" and "Company" fields are optional and we want to have the ability
to hide that section of the form**

First, we need to section off the "Age" and "Company" elements into their own
section, so we surround them with a `div`

```
div(id = "advanced",
  numericInput("age", "Age", 30),
  textInput("company", "Company", "")
)
```

We also need to add a link in the UI that will be used to hide/show the section  

```
a(id = "toggleAdvanced", "Show/hide advanced info")
```

Lastly, we need to tell Shiny to show/hide the section when the link is clicked
by adding this code to the server

```
shinyjs::onclick("toggleAdvanced",
                  shinyjs::toggle(id = "advanced", anim = TRUE))
```

**3. Similarly, since we don't really care about "Age" and "Company" too much, we
want to hide them initially when the form loads**

Simply surround the section we want to hide initially with `shinyjs::hidden`

```
shinyjs::hidden(
  div(id = "advanced",
    ...
))
```

**4. The user should be able to update the "Timestamp" in case he spends way too
long filling out the form (not very realistic here, and the timestamp should
ideally be determined when the button is clicked, but it's good enough for
illustration purposes)**

First, we need to add an "Update" link to click on, and we need to give the
element showing the time an `id` so that we can refer to it later when we
want to change its contents.

To do that, replace `p("Timestamp: ", span(date()))` with
`p("Timestamp: ", span(id = "time", date()), a(id = "update", "Update"))`

Now we need to tell Shiny what to do when "Update" is clicked by adding this
to the server

```
shinyjs::onclick("update", shinyjs::text("time", date()))
```

**5. Some users may find it hard to read the small text in the app, so there should
be an option to increase the font size**

First, we need to add checkbox to the UI

```
checkboxInput("big", "Bigger text", FALSE)
```

In order to make the text bigger, we will use CSS.  So let's add an appropriate
CSS rule first by adding this code to the UI

```
shinyjs::inlineCSS(list(.big = "font-size: 2em")),
```

Lastly, we want the text to be big or small depending on whether the checkbox
is checked by adding this code to the server

```
observe({
  if (input$big) {
    shinyjs::addClass("myapp", "big")
  } else {
    shinyjs::removeClass("myapp", "big")
  }
})
```

**6. Give the user a "Thank you" message upon submission**

This one's easy - just add the following to the server

```
observe({
  if (input$submit > 0) {
    shinyjs::info("Thank you!")
  }
})
```
