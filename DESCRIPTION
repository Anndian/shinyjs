Description: Using shinyjs lets you bring the power and flexibility of
    JavaScript into any Shiny application without requiring any JavaScript
    knowledge.  Many useful JavaScript functions are made available by
    shinyjs with a simple R interface so that you don't have to write any
    JavaScript code. Common functions such as hiding/showing elements,
    enabling/disabling buttons, and many more are supported by shinyjs.  Even
    if you do know JavaScript, shinyjs can be used as convenience functions
    to avoid dealing with message passing and writing JavaScript code.
