Description: Perform common JavaScript operations in Shiny
    applications without having to know any JavaScript. Many useful JavaScript
    functions are made available by shinyjs with a simple R interface so that
    you don't have to write any JavaScript code. Examples include hiding an
    element, disabling an input, resetting an input back to its original value,
    and many more useful functions. Even if you do know JavaScript,
    shinyjs can be used as convenience functions to avoid dealing with message
    passing and writing JavaScript code.
