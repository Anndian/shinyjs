Hmm, we see

*checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Package has a VignetteBuilder field but no prebuilt vignette index.

Found the following (possibly) invalid URLs:
  URL: http://daattali.com/shiny/shinyjs-demo/
    From: man/runExample.Rd
          man/shinyjs.Rd
    Status: 404
    Message: Not Found

The Title field should be in title case, current version then in title case:
‘Perform Common JavaScript Operations in Shiny apps using Plain R Code’
‘Perform Common JavaScript Operations in Shiny Apps using Plain R Code’

The Description field should not start with the package name,
  'This package' or similar.

so you either did not use current R or --as-cran.

Addressed previous note:

  Error: testthat unit tests failed
  
## My comments

Right, you did mention that, one of my functions requires V8 which is not available on very few platforms.  Inside the function I do use the recommended check using `requireNamespace` and if the package isn't available then I throw an error. I believe that's the correct thing to do.  The tests are failing on that platform because they expect output but they get an error - and I think that's correct behaviour.   The only fix I can think of is to check for the package availability inside the test suite itself -- is that right?  I thought it'd be ok to leave it as-is since the tests that are failing are tests that should fail on that platform.

## Reviewer comments

They should not fail if they rely on things not available on the platform.

And you are *STILL* not respecting

'All correspondence with CRAN must be sent to CRAN@R-project.org (not members of the team) and be in plain text ASCII (and not HTML).'

in two ways.
